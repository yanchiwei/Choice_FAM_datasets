# Testing Dataset for Choice-Based Airline Fleet Assignment and Schedule Design
This repository contains an additional synthetic testing dataset (based on realistic characteristics of data from a major carrier in 2016) for the paper ["Choice-Based Airline Schedule Design and Fleet Assignment: A Decomposition Approach"](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2022.1141) published in *Transportation Science*. If you use any of the material here, please include a reference to the paper and this webpage.


## Instance Summary
